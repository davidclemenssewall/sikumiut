Open a terminal program (terminal, iterm, etc.)

1. Install miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

   -- MacOS instructions (assuming "Apple Silicon": click apple menu and "About this Mac"
      to verify the chip is made by Apple; if made by Intel, go to website and follow the
      Intel directions... should just be a different Miniconda3-latest file)

   $ curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
   $ bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
      - say yes to prompts when asked
   $ conda config --set auto_activate_base true
   $ conda config --add channels defaults
   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
   $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
   $ rm -f Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

   -- Instructions for Windows and Linux are also available on the website

2. Quit your terminal program and reopen it. It should now open in the (base) environment.

3. In your (base) environment, install jupyter

  $ conda install mamba jupyterlab
     - say yes when prompted to proceed

4. If you have not already, clone this repository to your desktop. Then go to environment file

   $ cd sikumiut/cesm_activities

5. Install the (alaska) environment with

(base) $ mamba env create -f environment.yml

6. Run jupyter with

(base) $ jupyter lab

NOTES:

* You can choose a better name for the environment by editing the first line of
  environment.yml before running mamba

* You may want to pin a specific version of python; when I created this environment it used
  python 3.13, but if you were testing your notebooks with an older version you may be in
  for surprises

* The file browser in jupyter will use whatever directory you ran "jupyter lab" from as
  the root directory. You may want to do something like

  (base) $ cd /path/to/notebooks
  (base) $ jupyter lab

* Since we added ipykernel to the (alaska) environment, it should be usable from jupyter
  even though jupyter was launched from the (base) environment
