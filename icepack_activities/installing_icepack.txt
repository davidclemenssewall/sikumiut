These instructions were taken from the CICE Consortium documentation:

0. Icepack has been run successfully on Linux, Mac, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and in Docker containers. 
If you have access to any of those OS's, please follow the instructions below and let David know if you 
run into any issues.

1. You must install Miniconda. You should have already done this to install the python environment used
for the other two activities. If not, follow those instructions.

2. Initialize your shell for use with conda. Follow the instructions at the website above to do this.

3. Create the Icepack directories and the conda environment following section 3.2.3.4

4. Test that this worked following section 3.2.3.5

5. After confirming that the default test case works, go to Icepack_activities/Exercise_1_Elson_Icepack
and follow the instructions there for running the Elson Icepack simulation.
